<p>
  Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aꜜɲime] ⓘ) is hand-drawn and computer-generated
  animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers
  specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] However, in Japan and
  Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word
  animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Many
  works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also
  produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes and art
  styles that are sometimes labelled as anime.
